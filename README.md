Red velvet cake is my very favorite type.
It has an *amazing* taste and is the ideal birthday treat in my opinion.
My favorite recipe is taken from [here.](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/red-velvet-layer-cake-with-cream-cheese-frosting/)
I hope you try this recipe out for yourself.
**Thank you!**
